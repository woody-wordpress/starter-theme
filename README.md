## :fire: Installation & Usage

First, install Woody Theme via the Composer package manager:

## :wrench: CSS
At the begining, there was [Foundation by Zurb framework](https://foundation.zurb.com/), enhanced with the [Woody Library](https://github.com/woody-wordpress/woody-library).
Read [the framework documentation](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) and then, play with the theme :
- First, edit [the settings.scss file](https://github.com/woody-wordpress/starter-theme/blob/master/src/scss/settings/settings.scss)
- You can also override [the library's vars](https://github.com/woody-wordpress/woody-library/tree/master/assets/scss/vars) in [woody_vars.scss](https://github.com/woody-wordpress/starter-theme/blob/master/src/scss/settings/woody_vars.scss)
- Empty files are at your disposal to help you organize your css. It's up to you to use it or not.
